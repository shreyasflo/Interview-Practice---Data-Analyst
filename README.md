Employers use interviews to judge your readiness and fit for the job, which includes hearing about your skills and interest in the role. The interview is not a test or exam, but a conversation between you and the employer. Build your own strategies to be prepared come interview day. This project is one of many ways for you to practice!
Submission Instructions
Find a job posting that you would apply to now or after your Nanodegree graduation. Judge if you would be a good fit for the role. (Note: If you're more than 75% qualified for the job on paper, you're probably a good candidate and should give applying a shot!)
Answer the interview questions below as if you were answering them in an interview for that job.
Copy and paste the text of the job posting in "Notes to reviewer" during submission. Do not copy the job posting link, which can expire at any time.
Submit your interview questions as .pdf, text editor file, etc.
